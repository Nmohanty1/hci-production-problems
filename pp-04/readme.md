## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#composition
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
Within the accessibility element it is important that the most important items are
at the top of the sketch. It also states that elements should be clearly labeled and
visible. I felt like the background for the site and the font were not easy for the user to read.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html#usage
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I felt like on the original design the text fields were not very clear and mixed in with the background design too much so I thought it would be better if

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html#content-structure
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Content Structure is extremely important because that is what persuades a user to continue using the site and also complete orders. I thought that having the continue button after the benefits and second cardholder name was not an efficient way to organize the data.
