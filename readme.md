1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=10v0u0kg8qHoeb4qdbK7uPn9+Py
Your Rationale: I chose a brown family for the monochromatic color palette because you tend to see brown and beige colors in various buisnesses that are trying to give off a sense of warmth or home.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=50X0u0klEw0jLF5jkEznHswn0s4
Your Rationale: When I think of releasing springtime tours I think of bright colors because Spring is usually when all the flowers and trees come back. So I went with vibrant colors to match that

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=33P0U0kqft9gP-VgfySxSlJvTkp
Your Rationale: I went with the basic colors for this one. I did this because if you want it to be geared towards kids than it should have basic colors that every kid knows and that is welcoming. So I chose Blue, Red, and Yellow.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=c103P1u0y0kcglL4Zvw8Eq6eXhmkwen

Your Rationale: I like this pallette is my favorite. I feel like this pallete can be used in a professional work eviornment. I feel like it makes many people realize that which is why I think it would be perfect for advertisments.
